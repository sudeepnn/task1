# Section A : Making a simple website with vanilla JS

- **Task 1 - BootStrap**
- a. Use this [page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/pricing/), and create a modal - which gets called - whenever the user clicks on the pricing. The modal should contain a form - asking following details:
- [ ]  Name
- [ ]  Email
- [ ]  Order Comments
- From the bootstrap template, one should be able to click on any of the buttons of the three pricing tables, and fill in a form.

- b. Use a *slider* - which should allow user to scroll between the number of users - and suppose if the number of users are 0-10, then first plan should get highlighted, 10-20, the second plan should get highlighted, and so on.
- **Task 2 - vanilla JS**
